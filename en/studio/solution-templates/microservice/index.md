# ABP Studio: Microservice Solution Template

ABP Studio provides pre-architected and production-ready templates to jump start a new solution. One of them is the Microservice solution template. You can use it to build distributed systems with common microservice patterns. It includes multiple services, API gateways and applications that are well integrated to each other and ready to be a great base solution for your microservice system.

> **This document explains the Microservice solution template in every details. So, it is a reference document to fully understand the solution and refer when you have trouble.**
>
> **If you just want to quickly create a microservice solution, please refer to *[Quick Start: Creating a Microservice Solution with ABP Studio](../../quick-starts/microservice.md)* document.**
