# Add new Microservices to the Solution

> This documentation introduces guidance for creating a new microservice for your microservice startup template. Eventually, these steps will be automated in the future however learning these steps may provide insight to learn the relations between microservices.

## Creating new service

You can create a new service (sub microservice) into your microservice solution by using the ABP CLI. Use the following command to create a new service:

```powershell
abp new OrderService -t microservice-service-pro
```

The new service is created in the **services** folder of your solution. Build the new service with the following command. Run this command in the `\services\order` directory:

```bash
dotnet build
```

## Add the new service to the solution (Optional)

This is an optional step. If you want to see the OrderService in the main solution, add **Acme.BookStore.OrderService.HttpApi.Host.csproj** as an existing project to your main solution under the `services` folder. This will help you manage the host projects from single solution. While you can add it by Visual Studio (or any other IDE you are using), you can also run the following dotnet CLI command to add the Host project.

```bash
dotnet sln add services/order/src/Acme.BookStore.OrderService.HttpApi.Host/Acme.BookStore.OrderService.HttpApi.Host.csproj --solution-folder services
```

![Add to main solution](../../images/microservice-template-add-to-solution.png)

> Your solution can have errors when you try to build the main solution. This is because your newly added project has references out of your current solution. To restore your main application solution, use `dotnet build /graphBuild` dotnet tooling to restore it.

You need to update other dependent projects in order to integrate your new service into your composition.  Follow the next steps to integrate your new service.

## AuthServer Authentication Configuration

The newly added microservice has JwtBearer authentication configured with the `OrderService` audience under the **OrderServiceHttpApiHostModule** `ConfigureServices` class:

``````csharp
JwtBearerConfigurationHelper.Configure(context, "OrderService");
``````

To be able to consume this microservice, you will need to configure the AuthServer with this new scope.

There are 2 ways to add the newly added scope the the AuthServer environment. Using the OpenIddict Management UI **or** the OpenIddictDataSeeder.

### - Configuration using the OpenIddict Manager UI

Navigate to the Administration section and OpenId->Scopes then add **New Scope**:

![OpenIddict Management add new scope](../../images/microservice-template-add-new-scope.png)

The Resources section is the audience of the microservice. It must be the same with the JwtBearer authentication configuration of the new microservice.

### - Configuration using the OpenIddictDataSeeder

To keep `OpenIddictDataSeeder` updated, you need to do the following steps in the **OpenIddictDataSeeder.cs** class. Note that there are 2 **OpenIddictDataSeeder.cs** classes in the solution:

1. `Acme.BookStore.DbMigrator\OpenIddictDataSeeder.cs`
2. `Acme.BookStore.IdentityService.HttpApi.Host\DbMigrations\OpenIddictDataSeeder.cs`. 

If you will use the DbMigrator application you need to do the same steps in both classes.


- **Create ApiScope**: 

  To make OrderService to be consumable for other clients (applications/gateways/microservices), you should add it as a new scope by updating **CreateApiScopesAsync** method with: 

```csharp
await CreateScopesAsync("OrderService");
```

Now the newly created scope is available for your clients (applications, gateways, microservices).

## Client Configuration

Now the AuthServer must define **which clients can be able to make a request** to this newly created scope. Again, you can use both OpenIddict Management UI or the OpenIddictDataSeeder to configure it.

### - Configuration using the OpenIddict Managment UI

By default, there are 3 different clients exist in the microservice template. The **Public-Web** (landing page) application, the **back-office** application (web, angular, blazor or blazor-server based on your UI selection) and the **WebGateway_Swagger** client which is used for all the Swagger UIs (gateways and microservices).

Add the `OrderService` scope to the clients you want to make a request from. Navigate to the Administration section and OpenId->Applications then edit **WebGateway_Swagger**:

![WebGateway swagger update](../../images/microservice-template-swagger_client_update.png)

**Spesific to the WebGateway_Swagger client, you need to add the OrderService microservice URL to the redirect Uris.** 

`https://localhost:44459/swagger/oauth2-redirect.html`. Because the same client is used for all the microservices and the gateways.

For the back-office application or the public-web application, you don't need to add extra redirect Uri.

### - Configuration using the OpenIddictDataSeeder


- **Add Swagger Client Scopes**: 

  `WebGateway` swagger client is used to **authorize** the microservice endpoints via *authorization code* flow for the swagger endpoints. You need to update the swagger client scopes by adding the **OrderService** scope. You can select the gateways you want to grant for new service to be reached. **Keep in mind** that you need to add route configuration for each gateway. 

- **Update Clients**: 

  Update Web and/or Public (angular or blazor if application is not mvc) client creations in **CreateClientsAsync** method. Add **OrderService** scope. If you want to call **OrderService** from an other service, add **OrderService** scope to caller service client as well.

- **Create New Client:** 

  If you want **OrderService** to be able call the other services, you need to add the **OrderService** as a client under **CreateClientsAsync** as well. Then, update appsettings.json of the OrderService with **IdentityClients** section with the ClientId and granted scopes you have defined in **CreateClientAsync** method for client credential flow. For more information, see [Microservice Synchronous Interservice Communication](synchronous-interservice-communication.md) document.

  > AdministrationService microservice has configuration for making sync calls to IdentityService which can be examined if you are planning sync communication for your new microservice.  



> Hint: You can search for "*Product*" keyword in this class to find the places where you will add the OrderService.
- **Update file appsetting.json:** 
  Add OrderService with its address and port in the OpenIddict/Resources schema, the appsettings.json must be updated in Acme.BookStore.DbMigrator and Acme.BookStore.IdentityService.HttpApi.Host.DbMigrations.

Below you can see a screenshot of the final **OpenIddictDataSeeder.cs** , creating `OrderService `  `ApiScope` and granting it the `WebGateway` and other back-office clients.

![IdentityServerDataSeeder changes](../../images/microservice-template-dbmigrator-identityserver-seeder-update.png)

### Update the Swagger Client

There is a single swagger client called **WebGateway_Swagger** under the `OpenIddictDataSeeder.cs`. Create the **orderServiceRootUrl** which is used by the Swagger client for the OrderService swagger UI.

```csharp
private async Task CreateWebGatewaySwaggerClientsAsync()
{
    await CreateSwaggerClientAsync("WebGateway",
        new[] { "AccountService", "IdentityService", "AdministrationService", "SaasService", "ProductService", "OrderService" });
}

private async Task CreateSwaggerClientAsync(string name, string[]? scopes = null)
{
    var commonScopes = new List<string> {
        OpenIddictConstants.Permissions.Scopes.Address,
        OpenIddictConstants.Permissions.Scopes.Email,
        OpenIddictConstants.Permissions.Scopes.Phone,
        OpenIddictConstants.Permissions.Scopes.Profile,
        OpenIddictConstants.Permissions.Scopes.Roles
    };

    scopes ??= new[] { name };

    // Swagger Client
    var swaggerClientId = $"{name}_Swagger";
    if (!swaggerClientId.IsNullOrWhiteSpace())
    {
        var webGatewaySwaggerRootUrl = _configuration[$"OpenIddict:Applications:{name}:RootUrl"]?.EnsureEndsWith('/');
        var publicWebGatewayRootUrl = _configuration[$"OpenIddict:Applications:PublicWebGateway:RootUrl"]?.EnsureEndsWith('/');
        var accountServiceRootUrl = _configuration[$"OpenIddict:Resources:AccountService:RootUrl"]?.EnsureEndsWith('/');
        var identityServiceRootUrl = _configuration[$"OpenIddict:Resources:IdentityService:RootUrl"]?.EnsureEndsWith('/');
        var administrationServiceRootUrl = _configuration[$"OpenIddict:Resources:AdministrationService:RootUrl"]?.EnsureEndsWith('/');
        var saasServiceRootUrl = _configuration[$"OpenIddict:Resources:SaasService:RootUrl"]?.EnsureEndsWith('/');
        var productServiceRootUrl = _configuration[$"OpenIddict:Resources:ProductService:RootUrl"]?.EnsureEndsWith('/');
        var orderServiceRootUrl = _configuration[$"OpenIddict:Resources:OrderService:RootUrl"]?.EnsureEndsWith('/');

        await CreateApplicationAsync(
            name: swaggerClientId!,
            type: OpenIddictConstants.ClientTypes.Public,
            consentType: OpenIddictConstants.ConsentTypes.Implicit,
            displayName: "Swagger Client",
            secret: null,
            grantTypes: new List<string> { OpenIddictConstants.GrantTypes.AuthorizationCode, },
            scopes: commonScopes.Union(scopes).ToList(),
            redirectUris: new List<string> {
                $"{webGatewaySwaggerRootUrl}swagger/oauth2-redirect.html", // WebGateway redirect uri
                $"{publicWebGatewayRootUrl}swagger/oauth2-redirect.html", // PublicWebGateway redirect uri
                $"{accountServiceRootUrl}swagger/oauth2-redirect.html", // AccountService redirect uri
                $"{identityServiceRootUrl}swagger/oauth2-redirect.html", // IdentityService redirect uri
                $"{administrationServiceRootUrl}swagger/oauth2-redirect.html", // AdministrationService redirect uri
                $"{saasServiceRootUrl}swagger/oauth2-redirect.html", // SaasService redirect uri
                $"{productServiceRootUrl}swagger/oauth2-redirect.html", // ProductService redirect uri
                $"{orderServiceRootUrl}swagger/oauth2-redirect.html", // OrderService redirect uri
            }
        );
    }
}
```

Update the `appsettings.json` file of the **IdentityService** and the **DbMigrator** projects to add the OrderService URL as a redirect URI for the Swagger client:

```json
"OpenIddict": {
    "Applications": {      
      ...
    },
    "Resources": {
      ...
      "OrderService": {
        "RootUrl": "https://localhost:44459" // Add your OrderService URL
      }
    }
  }
```

> You can check the OrderService.HttpApi.Host appsettings.json `App:SelfUrl` key to find your OrderService URL.

## AuthServer CORS Configuration

When using the SwaggerUI from either gateway or the OrderService itself, the CORS for the AuthServer must be configured or you can come across the following error when you try to Authorize the Swagger UI:
![AuthServer CORS error](../../images/microservice-template-swagger-ui-cors-error.png)

To solve this problem, add the OrderService URL (https://localhost:44459) to the CorsOrigins of the AuthServer under the appsettings.json file:

```
  "App": {
    "SelfUrl": "https://localhost:44322",
    "CorsOrigins": "https://*.MvcStore.com,http://localhost:4200,https://localhost:44307,https://localhost:44325,https://localhost:44353,https://localhost:44367,https://localhost:44388,https://localhost:44381,https://localhost:44361,https://localhost:44459",
    ... 
```

## Updating Gateways

If you need to expose the new service endpoints, you need to configure the gateway of your choosing or all the gateways:  

- **WebGateway** 
- **PublicWebGateway**

### Gateway Authorization

Add the **OrderService** scope to the Swagger configuration of your gateways.

```
SwaggerConfigurationHelper
    .ConfigureWithOidc(
        context: context,
        authority: configuration["AuthServer:Authority"]!,
        scopes: new[] {
            /* Requested scopes for authorization code request and descriptions for swagger UI only */
            "AccountService", "IdentityService", "AdministrationService", "SaasService", "ProductService", "OrderService"
        },
        apiTitle: "Web Gateway API",
        discoveryEndpoint: configuration["AuthServer:MetaAddress"]
    );
```

2. **Update yarp.json for the route configuration:** 

   You need to add a new **Routes** and the **Cluster** for the new OrderService as shown below. 
   

```json
{
  "ReverseProxy": {
    "Routes": {
      ...
      "Order": {
        "ClusterId": "Order",
        "Match": {
          "Path": "/api/order-service/{**catch-all}"
        }
      },
      "OrderSwagger": {
        "ClusterId": "Order",
        "Match": {
          "Path": "/swagger-json/Order/swagger/v1/swagger.json"
        },
        "Transforms": [
          { "PathRemovePrefix": "/swagger-json/Order" }
        ]
      }
    },
    "Clusters": {
      ...
      "Order": {
        "Destinations": {
          "Order": {
            "Address": "https://localhost:44459/" <-- Your generated OrderService URL
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```



**Important**: The port `44459` is not same for all services. You can get your service port from `\services\order\src\Acme.BookStore.OrderService.HttpApi.Host\Properties\launchSettings.json` or the OrderService.HttpApi.Host appsettings.json `App:SelfUrl` key to find your OrderService URL.



  > The Transforms are used for the Swagger UI to obtain the correct swagger.json endpoints. See [YARP transforms docs](https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/articles/transforms.html) for more information.



## Updating DbMigrator

**You can skip this step if you do not want to use the DbMigrator to migrate the database of the OrderService.** If you want to use the DbMigrator to migrate all microservices in a central project, you should add the OrderService to the `DbMigrator` project as well to handle the new service migrations and data seeding. 

1. **Add OrderService Dependencies:** 

   Add **Acme.BookStore.OrderService.Application.Contracts** and **Acme.BookStore.OrderService.EntityFrameworkCore** project references to the **DbMigrator** project. The `EntityFrameworkCore` layer is required to migrate the **OrderServiceDbContext** and the `Application.Contracts` is used to migrate the permissions, features of the OrderService.
   
   Add the below `DependsOn` types to the **DbMigratorModule** as below:

* **Add csproj references:**

```json
<ProjectReference Include="..\..\services\order\src\Acme.BookStore.OrderService.Application.Contracts\Acme.BookStore.OrderService.Application.Contracts.csproj"/>
   
<ProjectReference Include="..\..\services\order\src\Acme.BookStore.OrderService.EntityFrameworkCore\Acme.BookStore.OrderService.EntityFrameworkCore.csproj"/>
```

* **Add DependsOn attributes**:
```csharp
typeof(OrderServiceApplicationContractsModule),
typeof(OrderServiceEntityFrameworkCoreModule)
```


   ![dbmigrator-service-modules-added-orderservice](../../images/dbmigrator-service-modules-added-orderservice.png)

   

2. **Update DbMigrationService:** 

   **DbMigratorHostedService** runs the [MigrateAsync()]() method which eventually runs the **MigrateAllDatabasesAsync** method. Add the new database migration with the others: 

```csharp
await MigrateDatabaseAsync<OrderServiceDbContext>(cancellationToken);
```

   ![migrate-all-after-orderservice](../../images/migrate-all-after-orderservice.png)



3. **Add connection string:** 

   DbMigrator gets connection string from configuration (`appsettings.json`). Each service has its own connection string. Add the OrderService connection string to the `appsettings.json` of the DbMigrator project. This name is defined in `OrderServiceDbProperties.ConnectionStringName`.
   
````json
"OrderService": "Server=(LocalDb)\\MSSQLLocalDB,1434;Database=BookStore_OrderService;User Id=sa;password=myPassw0rd;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
````

   ![Add connection string to DbMigrator](../../images/add-microservice-appsettings-conn-string.png)



## Adding UI to Applications

You can develop UI for your application in two different ways:

### 1-) Modular UI Development:

Develop your application UI like any ABP application template; add your pages under **OrderService.Web** project. This way, the back-office application will show the UI without hosting the microservice application just by using as a remote service. You can check [Module Architecture Best Practices & Conventions](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Best-Practices/Module-Architecture#layers-packages) **Section C** for more information. 

**Add your service UI to the back-office application:**

Add **HttpApi.Client** and **Web** (or **Blazor**) projects as references to the Web project and add new dependencies to **WebModule** as below:

* **Add csproj references**:

**MVC:** If your microservice project is MVC add the references to the `Acme.BookStore.Web.csproj`, if it's Blazor add the references to the `Acme.BookStore.Blazor.csproj`.

```json
<ProjectReference Include="..\..\..\..\services\order\src\Acme.BookStore.OrderService.HttpApi.Client\Acme.BookStore.OrderService.HttpApi.Client.csproj" />
    
<ProjectReference Include="..\..\..\..\services\order\src\Acme.BookStore.OrderService.Web\Acme.BookStore.OrderService.Web.csproj" />
```

 **Blazor**: If your project is Blazor then add the references to the `Acme.BookStore.Blazor.csproj`

```json
<ProjectReference Include="..\..\..\..\services\order\src\Acme.BookStore.OrderService.HttpApi.Client\Acme.BookStore.OrderService.HttpApi.Client.csproj" />
      
<ProjectReference Include="..\..\..\..\services\order\src\Acme.BookStore.OrderService.Blazor\Acme.BookStore.OrderService.Blazor.csproj" />
```

​    


* **Add DependsOn attributes**:

**MVC**:

```csharp
typeof(OrderServiceWebModule),
typeof(OrderServiceHttpApiClientModule)
```

**Blazor**:

```csharp
typeof(OrderServiceBlazorModule),
typeof(OrderServiceHttpApiClientModule)
```



**Add to OpenID Connect Scopes:**

You need to add the new service scope in your startup project. 

**MVC**: Open **BookStoreWebModule.cs** and add the below scope in `AddAbpOpenIdConnect()` method.

**Blazor**: Open **BookStoreBlazorModule.cs** and add the below scope in `AddAbpOpenIdConnect()` method.

```csharp
options.Scope.Add("OrderService");
```

> ProductService.Web module is designed this way. You can examine ProductService.Web project for the sample implementation.



This approach can benefit you to have backend and frontend integrity in your microservice as a whole, as you can develop the backend and frontend of your microservice in the same microservice solution.

![Add to startup project reference](../../images/add-microservice-web-csproj.png)





### 2-) Monolith UI Development inside application:

Develop your application UI inside the application; add your pages under application layer of your solution and use microservice as a remote service. You can check [Module Architecture Best Practices & Conventions](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Best-Practices/Module-Architecture#layers-packages) **Section D** for more information.  In this approach, you can separate the front-end and back-end team and develop each in their reputable solution.

**To add your microservice UI to your application (PublicWeb application in this case):**

Add **HttpApi.Client** reference to **PublicWeb** project and add new dependency to **PublicWebModule** as below:

* **Add csproj reference**:

```json
<ProjectReference Include="..\..\..\..\services\order\src\Acme.BookStore.OrderService.HttpApi.Client\Acme.BookStore.OrderService.HttpApi.Client.csproj" />
```

* **Add DependsOn attribute:**

```csharp
typeof(OrderServiceHttpApiClientModule)
```
![Add to public web](../../images/add-microservice-publicweb.png)


> You can check out the sample project ProductService.PublicWeb module to understand this implementation.

### Updating Angular application:

If you are using the Angular application, you need to add the new scope to the **oAuthConfig** in `envrionment.ts`:

![angular-add-scope](../../images/angular-add-scope.png)

### Creating Static Proxy

When the application makes a a request to the newly added microservice through the gateway, it will use the REST API information of the newly added service. By default, the OrderService uses Static proxies that you need to generate them manually. To generate static proxy for the OrderService, run the OrderService HttpApi.Host and then for **MVC/Blazor/Blazor-Server** applications, use the abp command under the `OrderService.HttpApi.Client` project:

``````powershell
abp generate-proxy -t csharp -u https://localhost:44459/ -m OrderService --without-contracts
``````

for **Angular** application

``````powershell
abp generate-proxy -t ng -u https://localhost:44459/ -m OrderService --without-contracts
``````

This will generate the static proxy for the application services of your OrderService that will be used by the application.
For more information, check https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/API/Static-CSharp-API-Clients.

## Updating Tye configuration:

If you are planning to use [Tye](https://github.com/dotnet/tye) to develop and deploy microservices, you need to update your `tye.yaml` configuration which exists in the root directory of your solution. Add **OrderService.HttpApi.Host.csproj** path and port with self-sign development certification information as below:

```yaml
- name: order-service
  project: services/order/src/Acme.BookStore.OrderService.HttpApi.Host/Acme.BookStore.OrderService.HttpApi.Host.csproj
  bindings:
    - protocol: https
      port: 44459 <-- Your generated OrderService port
  env:
    - Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=../../../../etc/dev-cert/localhost.pfx
    - Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password=e8202f07-66e5-4619-be07-72ba76fde97f // <- Your generated certificate passphrase
```

**Important**: The port `44459` is not same for all services. You can get your service port from `\services\order\src\Acme.BookStore.OrderService.HttpApi.Host\Properties\launchSettings.json`



![Tye config](../../images/add-microservice-tye-config.png)





## Running the Solution

Simply use the `run-tye.ps1` PowerShell script. **Which does all the steps below:**

**1- Create dev certificates:** This is a one time operation. You need to create dotnet HTTPS certificates with the following PowerShell command:

```bash
\etc\dev-cert\create-certificate.ps1
```

**2- Start the infrastructure:**  Run the following PowerShell script to start the infrastructures:

```bash
etc\docker\up.ps1
```

**3- Run the DbMigrator:** Run the DbMigrator project to migrate the databases and seed the initial required data to use the applications:

```bash
cd "./shared/Acme.BookStore.DbMigrator"
dotnet run
```

**3- Run tye**: Run the following command in the root directory of your solution where `tye.yaml` exists. The `watch` parameter allows to build projects when the source code changes.

```bash
tye run --watch
```

Open your browser and navigate to your startup URL:

* **Blazor Server**: [https://localhost:44314](https://localhost:44314/)
* **Blazor Web Assembly**: [https://localhost:44307](https://localhost:44307/)
* **MVC**: [https://localhost:44321](https://localhost:44321/)
* **Angular**: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200/)

## Deployment

If you are using K8s and Helm charts, don't forget to add new helm chart for the new OrderService and update the deployment and values .yaml files of related application and gateway charts.
