# Application (Single Layer) Startup Template

This startup template is used to create applications quickly without striving with a layered architecture. This template has the same functionality, features and modules on runtime with the [Application Startup Template](../application/index.md) but the development model is minimal and everything is in a single project (`.csproj`).
