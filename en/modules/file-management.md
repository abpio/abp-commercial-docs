# File Management Module

This module is used to upload, download and organize files in a hierarchical folder structure. It is also compatible to multi-tenancy and you can determine total size limit for your tenants.

This module is based on the [BLOB Storing](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Blob-Storing) system, so it can use different storage providers to store the file contents.

See [the module description page](https://commercial.abp.io/modules/Volo.FileManagement) for an overview of the module features.

## How to Install

File Management module is not installed in [the startup templates](../Startup-Templates/Index). So, it needs to be installed manually. There are two ways of installing a module into your application.

### 1. Using ABP CLI

ABP CLI allows adding a module to a solution using `add-module` command. You can check its [documentation](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/CLI#add-module) for more information. So, file management module can be added using the command below;

```bash
abp add-module Volo.FileManagement
```

### 2. Manual Installation

If you modified your solution structure, adding module using ABP CLI might not work for you. In such cases, file management module can be added to a solution manually.

In order to do that, add packages listed below to matching project on your solution. For example, `Volo.FileManagement.Application` package to your **{ProjectName}.Application.csproj** like below;

```json
<PackageReference Include="Volo.FileManagement.Application" Version="x.x.x" />
```

After adding the package reference, open the module class of the project (eg: `{ProjectName}ApplicationModule`) and add the below code to the `DependsOn` attribute.

```csharp
[DependsOn(
  //...
  typeof(FileManagementApplicationModule)
)]
```

If your project is using `EntityFrameworkCore`, you need to add following configuration to `OnModelCreating` method at your `DbContext`.

If your project is using `MongoDB`, you need to add following configuration to `CreateModel` method at your `DbContext`.

```csharp
builder.ConfigureFileManagement();
```

> If you are using EntityFrameworkCore, do not forget to add a new migration and update your database.

File Management module's MVC user interface depends on following npm packages. add `@volo/file-management` npm package to your `package.json` file.

```json
"dependencies": {
    ...
    "@volo/file-management": "^2.9.0"
  }
```

> After adding packages, you need to run `yarn` and `gulp` cli actions for your `Web` project.

####Â Angular UI

For user interface, we also provide an Angular module. 

You can install it to your project by running `yarn add @volo/abp.ng.file-management` or `npm install @volo/abp.ng.file-management`

For detailed information about how to set it up and running with your angular project, you can visit [Feature Libraries](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/UI/Angular/Feature-Libraries) 

## Setting BLOB Provider

File Management module is based on the [BLOB Storing](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Blob-Storing) system as defined before, and it uses `FileManagementContainer` as a BLOB container.

You must set a BLOB provider for `FileManagementContainer`.

```csharp
Configure<AbpBlobStoringOptions>(options =>
{
    options.Containers.Configure<FileManagementContainer>(c =>
    {
        c.UseDatabase(); // You can use FileSystem or Azure providers also.
    });
});
```

Please check the [BLOB Storage Providers documentation](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Blob-Storing#blob-storage-providers) for more information about providers and how to use them.

## Packages

This module doesn't seed any data.

## Internals

### Domain Layer

#### Aggregates

This module follows the [Entity Best Practices & Conventions](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Best-Practices/Entities) guide.

##### TextTemplateContent

- `DirectoryDescriptor` (aggregate root): Represents a folder.
- `FileDescriptor` (aggregate root): Represents a file.

#### Repositories

This module follows the [Repository Best Practices & Conventions](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Best-Practices/Repositories) guide.

Following custom repositories are defined for this module:

- `IDirectoryDescriptorRepository`
- `IFileDescriptorRepository`

#### Domain Services

This module follows the [Domain Services Best Practices & Conventions](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Best-Practices/Domain-Services) guide.

##### DirectoryManager

`DirectoryManager` is used to manage your folders like create, rename, move and delete.

##### FileManager

`FileManager` is used to manage your files like create, rename, move and delete.

### Settings

This module doesn't define any setting.

### Features

You can enable or disable this module for each tenant, also you can set maximum storage size for each tenant.
See the `FileManagementFeatures` class members for all features defined for this module.

### Application Layer

#### Application Services

- `DirectoryDescriptorAppService` (implements `IDirectoryDescriptorAppService`): Implements the use cases of the file management UI.
- `FileDescriptorAppService` (implements `IFileDescriptorAppService`): Implements the use cases of the file management UI.

### Database Providers

#### Common

##### Table/Collection Prefix & Schema

All tables/collections use the `Fm` prefix by default. Set static properties on the `FileManagementDbProperties` class if you need to change the table prefix or set a schema name (if supported by your database provider).

##### Connection String

This module uses `FileManagement` for the connection string name. If you don't define a connection string with this name, it fallbacks to the `Default` connection string.

See the [connection strings](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Connection-Strings) documentation for details.

#### Entity Framework Core

##### Tables

- **FmDirectoryDescriptors**
- **FmFileDescriptors**
